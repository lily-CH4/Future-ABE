                        Welcome! This platform was developed as a self-directed review tool for the Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering Licensure Exam (ABELE). As a student preparing for the board exam, I built this site to support my own learning, and now I'm sharing it in the hope it might benefit others as well.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        While I intend to enroll in a formal review center, I realized early on that I needed a flexible and interactive way to study that aligned with my own learning style. This site allows me to practice through randomized quizzes, get instant feedback, and stay engaged, especially during solo study sessions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        This is not an official review program, but rather a personal initiative to supplement my preparation, stay motivated, and track my progress. Whether you're preparing on your own or alongside a review center, I hope this tool supports your journey in some way.
                    </p>
